title: Estimating House Price
---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Project 2 at Metis, named 'Luther', the goal was to gain exposure to regression methods, understanding their use and practice 
implementing them using statsmodels or scikit-learn. For my project I decided to predict the price of a house.
Being able to predict house prices would be beneficial not only to real estate agents but also home owners looking to sell their house as well
as potential home owners looking for a house. If you want to be the best real estate agent trying to determine the best price your client
can sell their house/ buy a house or if you are a home owner trying to determine the best price you could sell your house for or a potential 
house owner trying to find a house at the best price then you use machine learning techniques to build the best model to predict the value 
of a house.

**Data Gathering**  

As a part of the data gathering process, I scraped the current listings from Zillow using Python and Selenium. I fetched data for all zipcodes
starting with "94" which covered listings from bay area in Northern California. The scraped data included 10500 property listings and created 
the following 11 features for each listing from the data-
Address, city, state, zipcode, price, sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms, days on zillow, sale type and url.

**Data Preparation**  

Data preparation phase included the following steps as a part of the data cleaning process-
1. Observations having 'Lot/Land for sale' and 'Foreclosures' as the sale type were removed.
2. Imputed values for NAs in the observations for the sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms, days on zillow features by determining the median of each
   column by zipcode.
3. Dummy variables were generated for the 'zip' and 'city' categorical features.
4. Features such as 'price', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft', 'days on zillow' were scaled appropriately.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**  

Correlations amongst the independent variables and amongst the independent and dependent variables were determined as a part of exploratory
data analysis. Features such as zip codes and cities with high p values were not included while creating models. 

I used Random Forest algorithm for determining the important features. Following are the top 5 features ranked by Random Forest to 
be the most important ones-

Feature	| Importance
------- | ----------
	
1. Square Footage | 0.446363635
2. Bathrooms | 0.247329075
3. Days on Zillow | 0.051874401
4. Bedrooms	| 0.029288508
5. San Francisco | 0.017151906

Figure 1 below showcases the price prediction with respect to number of bathrooms.

Figure 2 below highlights the six most priciest neighborhoods in San Francisco bay area.

**Choosing the best classifier**  

To determine the best classifier, I ran different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Polynomial regression with lasso,
Decision tree, Bagged tree and Random forest. Adjusted R-square was the metric used to compare model results.

The outcomes for the algorithms were as follows:  

Model |	R-Square (Adjusted) 
----- | -------------------

1. Linear Regression | 0.4529
2. Polynomial Regression 
   of the 2nd order with lasso | 0.6039
3. Decision Tree | 0.4905
4. Bagged Tree 	| 0.6259
5. Random Forest |	0.5125

Based on comparison of the various model outcomes, Bagged tree seems to be the best fit classifier followed by polynomial regression.

**Conclusion**  

*	Square Footage, Bathrooms, Days on Zillow, Bedrooms and San Francisco have been observed to be the most predictive variables for the 
    price of a house.
*	Oakville, Atherton, Hillsborough, Altos Hills, Tiburon and Belvedere were observed to be the priciest neighborhoods in SanFrancisco 
	bay area.
	
**Next Steps**  

* 	Analyse and consider including additional features such as Property Tax, School ratings, Year Built and proximity to transit stations
  	to improve the performance of the model.
